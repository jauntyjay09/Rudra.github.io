        <hr class="my-4">
        <p>Project RUDRA in VIT- AP University is a one of its kind that essentially opens up a platform for voluntary donation and a community of like-minded individuals aiming to bring about a change in the way individual and environmental well being is perceived. 

        </p>
        <p>"Donate Your Humanity and Visualise the Love‚Äù is the motto of our organization, representing the very idea for the inception of the project.  

        </p>
        <p>However, it's not just about item donation or change in ideation, in fact, we include artistic and sessions, wherein, everyone is welcome to come and witness the open house, filled with artistic recreation of items, considered useless by their past owners. 

        </p>
        <p>We conduct well- being sessions that focus on individual and environmental well-being. Thus by combining the triad of ideas, viz. voluntary donation, change in ideation and artistic recreation, we at RUDRA, believe that we have created a unique combination that has the potential to bring about a transformative change in the society.
